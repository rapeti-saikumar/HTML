		For the fifth year in a row, Finland is number one when it comes to happiness. The country consistently ranks among the top education systems in the world, occasionally beaten out by countries like South Korea, Japan, and Singapore. Much of that success comes from a widespread reverence for teachers, who are required to have a master’s degree (their education is state-funded), 
		and a pedagogical system that focuses less on quantitative testing and more on experiential learning and equal opportunity.

		<li id="2"><strong><big style="font-size:200%;">Denmark</big></strong></li>
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark"><img src="https://media.cntraveler.com/photos/5e8514862e6ca30009d1d551/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/denmark-happiest-countries-GettyImages-1187647589.jpg"
			style="width:800px; height:500px;"></a>
		<p style="font-size:120%;">
		Denmark remained in the number two spot this year. The country rates near the top in all the reported metrics—life expectancy, social support, and 
		generosity among them—but it is also a country hugely committed to renewable energy production (39.1 percent of its energy was wind-generated in 2014). A recent study from the Copenhagen-based Happiness Research Institute (whose existence is probably reason enough for a top spot) narrows down Denmark’s happiness to a number of different categories, including trust in the government, economic security, freedom, civil participation, and work-life balance.

		<li id="3"><strong><big style="font-size:200%;">Iceland</big></strong></li>
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceland"><img src="https://media.cntraveler.com/photos/623be69e752977bb5a19bc35/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Husavik-Iceland-GettyImages-1268467220.jpg"
			style="width:800px; height:500px;"></a>
		<p style="font-size:120%;">
		Iceland ranks high in terms of the proportion of respondents who said they felt like they had a fellow citizen to count on when the going gets rough. This perhaps became most obvious in the wake of the country's post-2007 financial collapse and subsequent revitalization. You’d think that the perpetual flood of American tourists into Reykjavik might have dealt a blow to the residents’ happiness—it’s got to be a little harder to get that dinner reservation than it used to be, after all—but when it comes to well-being, the Icelanders are unfazed. Perhaps it has something to do with the fact that they can always escape the city to a countryside that looks like another planet.

		<li id="4"><strong><big style="font-size:200%;">Switzerland</big></strong></li>
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland"><img src="https://media.cntraveler.com/photos/623bea32990a40bde35f791a/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Switzerland-michal-kmet-gfXT4unIejE-unsplash.jpg"
			style="width:800px; height:500px;"></a>
		<p style="font-size:120%;">
		Switzerland (which dropped one spot this year) is a country where everything is voted on, from how many vacation days workers should have to how many immigrants should be allowed into the country, and referendums down to the local level happen many times a year. This system of direct democracy means that Swiss citizens feel an unparalleled sense of participation in their country’s evolution. The Swiss are known to be insular, and it can be off-putting to first-time visitors, but there is a strong social fabric held together by a belief that every voice matters, which can go a long way toward feeling content.

		<li id="5"><strong><big style="font-size:200%;">Netherlands</big></strong></li>
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands"><img src="https://media.cntraveler.com/photos/623beef1428be06d8569e895/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Netherlands-GettyImages-1089977904.jpg"
			style="width:800px; height:500px;"></a>
		<p style="font-size:120%;">
		The biggest stat from the Netherlands this year? That its happiness levels have barely changed (we’re talking less than 0.03 percent) between 2005 and 2021. And in the Netherlands, it turns out, happiness starts young. A 2013 UNICEF report rated Dutch children the happiest in the world, based on a number of metrics related to educational well-being, safety, and health.
